# Codenator ü§ñÔ∏è
**Automatic code generation and execustion using Large Language Models**<br><br>
Codenator is a scalible AWS cloud solution for generating, testing, scanning and executing code.
## Codenator in Action

## Features
It currently supports the following features:
- LLM Agent interaction Code generation using *Bedrock* or models hosted on *Amazon SageMaker endpoints*.
- Easy integration with new released models.
- Code security scan with Amazon *CodeGuru* or [*SemGrep*](https://semgrep.dev/).
- Code execution in sandboxed docker container with encrypted input powered by *Amazon KMS*.
- Automatic execution failure feedback and correction.
- Code execution requires manual approval for increased security.
- Task storage and retrieval powered by *Amazon Opensearch Serverless*, to allow interaction with a task at later time.
- Shared storage folder to allow exchanging files between agent and code executor.
## Architecture
![Codenator Architecture](assets/codenator-architecture.png)<br>
Below is an overview description of each component. To dive deep into each one, click on the provided link for each componsent.
* [API layer (LLM Service)](src/codenator/api_layer/README.md): Responsible for unifing LLM invocations. It uses *ECS Fragate* and *Amazon DynamoDB* to interact with various LLM service providers and add new ones without the need to change code.
* [Prompt Store](src/codenator/controller/app/prompt/README.md): Powered by *DynamoDB*, enables storage, modification, versioning and retrieval of prompts at runtime.
* [Controller (orchestration layer)](src/codenator/controller/README.md): Holds the the main logic for the Codenator agent and acts as a central component for the solution.  
* WebUI (UI layer): Gradio app web ui.
* [Code Executor (task executor)](src/codenator/code_executor/README.md): Executes code in sandbox, script must be encrypted with *Amazon KMS*. Currently supports *Python*, *Java*, *JavaScript*, *R*, *Julia*, *Bash* and *Shell*.
* [Task store](src/codenator/task_store/README.md): Powered by *Amazon Opensearch Serverless*, to save and retrieve tasks.
* [Code scanner (Security Check/Guradrail)](src/codenator/code_scanner/README.md): Performs static code scanning to detect any vulnerabilities in generated code. Currently supports *Amazon CodeGuru* and *SemGrep* scanners.
* feedback: User feedback hosted on S3.
* logging: Conversation logging to S3.
## Security

## Authentication Layer
You can optionally to include an authentication layer to your application, which will enforce all users to get authenticated by Cognito Userpool prior accessing your application. To use authentication, the following tempaltes will be used:
* [auth-layer.yaml](/deployment/CloudFormation/auth-layer.yaml): This template is used to create Cognito Userpool and App Client to authenticate users coming to Web-UI Application Load Balancer
* [root-tempalte-auth.yaml](/deployment/CloudFormation/root-template-auth.yaml): This tempalte is built on top of [root-template](/deployment/CloudFormation/root-template.yaml) with following changes:
1. Requires `PublicDomainName` and `Certificate` to integrate Cognito Userpool to Web-UI Application Load Balancer
2. Adds a new nested stack `AuthLayerStack` which 
3. Adds dependency of `AuthLayerStack` to `WebUIService`
* [web-ui-auth.yaml](/deployment/CloudFormation/web-ui-auth.yaml): This tempalte is built on top of [web-ui.yaml](/deployment/CloudFormation/root-web-ui-auth.yaml) with following changes:
1. Add HTTPS Listener Rules to enforce unauthenticated requests to get authenticated by Cognito Userpool App Client.
2. Updates default behaviour of HTTPS Listener to redirect all requests to get authenticated.
